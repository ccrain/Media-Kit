Mission Statement

The Greenwich International Film Festival: Excellence in Film

The Greenwich International Film Festival will allow filmmakers from across the globe to showcase their vision in front of a highly engaged group of artists, financiers, distributors. unique to the area. The Festival aims to draw from successful festivals that have come before, but also allows film makers to carve out a new niche. We are committed to making GIFF an essential destination on the festival circuit. Greenwich will elevate the art of film not only for those who have already had success in film, but for those individuals for whom filmmaking is still a far off dream. We will provide workshops and seminars throughout the year on all aspects of film, the visual arts and the new technologies so critical in modern filmmaking.  Greenwich will also benefit from the Festival as it will stimulate the local economy and build off existing local film communities, leveraging what we have accomplished in the past and moving forward in a unified manner to do something transformational to the region.The Greenwich International Film Festival will be an international, highly curated, working film festival. 

Why Festival
There is a void in the movie marketplace- Just over 5% of films made actually make it to a movie screen. There is an urgent need for filmmakers to find funding and distribution where big budget movies often dominate even Oscar-worthy indies. We feel film lovers have a responsibility to encourage good movies to be made and seen. Independent filmmakers released more than 75% of all films in 2012-an increase of 17% from the year before, while pictures released by major studios decreased by almost 10% in that same period (Motion Picture Association of America). Film Festivals such as Sundance and Toronto have become integral tools in getting first rate movies made, however,  there is an urgent need for another stage, as even these venues have moved beyond independent filmmaking. 


Why Greenwich?
Greenwich, CT is home to some of the world’s most successful and influential leaders of industry and is a globally recognized destination.  Capitalizing on these strengths will provide something unique to filmmakers.  We expect extraordinary support from both the local government and businesses, along with unbridled enthusiasm from the 60,000+ Greenwich residents.  . The median household income in Greenwich is nearly 500% more than the national average. Greenwich is more than just an East Coast financial hub, it is a place well known for extensive philanthropy and a deep commitment to the arts. Building on this existing brand is a natural progression. Greenwich will allow filmmakers to expose their works to the people who can make them a success.  The people of Greenwich will welcome them with open arms.  
Greenwich also has an ideal location, just 45 minutes via train from NYC and  accessible by car, train, boat and plane. In addition, both Westchester and Fairfield counties should be well represented at GIFF. 

What?
The Greenwich International Film Festival will be a three day event that will launch in June of 2015 and will show 24 highly curated films from different genres. The films will be shown in downtown Greenwich generally, and allow for simple logistics and all-around vibrant experience in a beautiful place. Greenwich is easy to access by train, and once there, very easy to navigate. It will be an unprecedented opportunity for filmmakers to have their work seen by those that can turn their dreams into reality .The Festival will be supported throughout the year by events and forums that keep GIFF relevant to local residents year round. 

Your Brand
The Festival will present an opportunity for various brands to associate themselves with the affluent landscape of Greenwich and the excellence of The Greenwich International Film Festival and the filmmaers we attract. Events, forums and screenings will all provide your brand the exposure that it desires.  Social media an interactive website will ensure GIFF is not just an event, but that it will be part of this community’s everyday life.


Supporting Events
Events will support the Festival and include discussions with actors, directors, film makers, new media executives and financial power players. These interactions will be critical in setting the stage for the event. Use of social media throughout the year will help the Festival support its artists both before and after the Festival, a key differentiator between The Greenwich International Film Festival and others. The Founders are confident that the Festival, along with on going monthly forums, educational workshops, and other affiliated events, that Greenwich will rapidly establish itself as a premier location for film.  We also feel quite certain that local politicians and businesses will be compelled to supoort filmmakers and sponsors in these supoorting events.
